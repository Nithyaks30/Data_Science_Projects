-------------   RECOMENDATION  

-----ACTUALLY HERE WE HAVE GOOD CHURNED DATA BECAUSE LAST PURCHASE IS LESS THAN 20 DAYS AND AMONG PRODUCTS MOST OF ARE BELONGS TO LONG CYCLE EXCEPT GROCERY

--Long purchase cycle items are purchased by many so within 20 days is not a big deal for all items expect grocery
     --NEW customers may be didnt find valuable items,and missed oppurtunity so we should recommended items based on purchase pattern 
     --and sending notification ,doing campaigns
--these are the recommendation for the customers who are --- NEW users BECAUSE CHUERNED MAIN REASON ARE NEW CUSTOMERS
--------------Major concern is customer who are not loyal means of tenure less than 2 years are churned  
---login through computer is an issue to new users so 
       ---we can improve user experience  by optimize the computer login
	   ---onboarding assistence by Target support for newer customers
------for tier 3 and 2 we need to use retention strategies by giving incentives for new users
---- we need to check out problem in cash on delivery and e wallet
----device management tool for managing registration easily 
------loyalty program for targetting single cusomers and all new users 
--Diversify the product offering can reduce churnrate of one perticular product(promotion)
---there are many reason but giving  innovative product and engaging statisfied customer can help 
---- need to find root cause for complaints
----for retaining zero days from last order we can proactive customer service,seamless return and Exchange process,offer a next purchase incentive
